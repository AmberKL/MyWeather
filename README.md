# MyWeather

As my first project I have decided to create a weather app with the use of APIs to flex my abilities in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Its been a challenging first project, but I've enjoyed every moment of it and I'm keen for my next project.

I'd love to hear your thoughts, or to connect on LinkedIn.
